# 🎵 Real-time Emotion-Based Music Recommendation

## 🎯 Project Overview
An intelligent music recommendation system that analyzes user emotions in real-time through facial expressions, voice tone, and text input to suggest personalized music.

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### 1. Emotion Detection Methods
- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Using computer vision (OpenCV + deep learning)
- **Voice Sentiment Analysis**: Audio processing for emotional tone detection
- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: NLP for chat/text-based emotion detection
- **Multi-modal Fusion**: Combining all inputs for better accuracy

### 2. Music Recommendation Engine
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Audio features analysis (tempo, key, energy)
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User behavior patterns
- **Emotion-Music Mapping**: Custom dataset linking emotions to music features
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency recommendation updates

### 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with real-time video/audio capture
- **Backend**: FastAPI for REST APIs
- **ML Models**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for emotion detection
- **Audio Processing**: librosa, spotify-web-api
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for caching
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS/GCP
